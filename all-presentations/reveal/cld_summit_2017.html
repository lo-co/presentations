                        I suggested that maybe you should consider using this awesome new paradigm in LabVIEW.  </p>

                    <p>
                        Before we start demo - how many are familiar with web services or have used them before?  And
                        by used I mean how many have used them in real, intense applications?  You can leave now...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before showing the answer, demo what a web service request-response looks like.
                        This is similar to one of the NI basic examples - show what this looks like if you use a terminal
                        reponse vs a buffered response.  Gives insight into why you might want to use one or the other.</p>
                    <p>
                        Also, point out that this using a terminal response will have implications for <i>how</i>
                        you interpret the response on the client side.

                    <p>So, there is a lot of relaying going on here which will mean a lot of boiler plate.  You have to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Send a command from client to the server.  </li>
                        <li>Forward that request onto the program controller and possibly the model</li>
                        <li>The model will have to respond to the input and update as necessary</li>
                        <li>There must be some mechanism for aggregating the data or you will fragment the service (at the controller level?)</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the controller has updated the model, we will ultimately want to communicate that updated data
                    back to the client via the server.  However, the client will have to tell the server that it wants the
                    data.  Once this is done, the data must be translated to something that the client can interpret
                    somewhere - either in the service (my recommendation so the server doesn't have to keep a record of it) or
                    possibly at the controller level.</p>

                    <p>Well, now we have the fundamentals, so where do we go from here.  For many of us, applications
                        are considerably more complex - they will require more than a single button and likely have more
                        complex views for the data.  As such, we will have to consider <i>how</i> to structure our application
                        with regards to both the look as well as the operation.  The process is considerably more
                        complex than in LabVIEW.  Building views can take a lot of code on browser based code to support
                        the operation.
                    </p>
                    <p>In most LV applications, client and server are often one in the same or the way data is handled
                        makes the process of maintaining synchronization fairly straightforward.  Nevertheless, if you have
                        done something like this in pure LabVIEW, then you know <i>what</i> to do; it's just the mechanics
                        of <i>how</i> that you will have to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>With respect to multiple views, this is akin to tabs in LabVIEW.  However, using multiple
                        browser tabs for developing an application may cause synchronization issues and will likely
                        increase bandwidth usage due to polling across multiple applications.  This is bad.
                    </p>
                    <p>Along those lines, due to the fact that all data is returned in text form we will see an increase
                        in bandwidth usage.  Depending on how large the data packets are, the developer may want to
                        consider how they use that bandwidth.  Can they defer some data updates depending on the view
                        that they are in? (example: exscalabar)

                        There is not enough time to go over how to build a fully functional client side application.
                        But it is important to consider that beyond the vanilla - html, js and css - there are a lot
                        of tools and frameworks out there to aid you.  You do not have to reinvent the wheel.  In fact,
                        that would be a tremendous waste of time that would produce a product that was deficient wrt
                        what is already out there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Is anyone familiar with any of these tools that are depicted up here? Anyone heard of jQuery?
                        Probably one of the most popular tools for those new to the whole web development thing.  This
                        provides utilities for manipulating the DOM and css; provides HTML event methods; simplifies
                        AJAX calls; and provides a whole host of other utilities.  You would recognize calls to the
                        jQuery library by the ubiquitous $.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, jQuery is not a firm foundation for an application architecture.  For this, you might want
                        to take advantage of some of the awesome frameworks out there such as AngularJS, Backbone, React,
                        Ember, etc, etc (there is a lot of churn out there).  All of these will help you build single page
                        applications that deal with issues laid out in the previous slide.  I have used AngularJS - it
                        is awesome but difficult to get a foothold in.  The transition from v1 to v2 broke the framework
                        (I can no longer say that I am familiar with AngularJS).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to these frameworks, we have Elm.  It is a functional language that transpiles to
                        javascript.  And unlike Angular and React, does not require a server to run.  In addition, it has
                        the whole MVC architecture built into its language.  And, it is statically typed so you
                        won't get frustrating errors like this (show throwError button).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You also have tools to help with styling such as Bootstrap (which v4 is finally in beta) and
                        Google's Material Design.  These provide widgets to create a consistent UI experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, you have development tools such as Gulp to aid in the actual development of your
                        application (remember that javascript is interpreted by the browser and is generally not run
                        anywhere else) so these tools will provide packages for liniting, concatenating, minifying
                        etc.

                        On the server side, you will have to provide some (a considerable amount?) of support code to
                        communicate with the server and maintain state between the client and server sides.  In addition,
                        you are going to have to step outside of your LV box and get comfortable with new progamming
                        paradigms.  Given the time commitment for taking on this, this is not for everyone, but if you
                        have the time, maybe you should consider it for these reasons...

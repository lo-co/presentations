                    <p>ALARM website - is everyone registered?  change in late 2015 i think that did not
                        respect previous settings...so, if you were getting emails regarding topics you may no
                        longer be getting them</p>
                    <p>lol - notice the topic "Call for Presentations" - 0 replies</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Matt gave polyglot talk - awesome</li>
                        <li>CLD summit talk on repo - awesome</li>
                        <li>
                            so many awesome talks here and all because of people like you who were willing to get up
                            and talk
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            this has been a frustration of mine (and probably people who I am more familiar with as
                            they get called on all the time by me
                        </li>
                        <li>I am once again leading the group meeting in September (?) - don't make Matt talk to you again</li>
                        <li>Whoever is leading the next next meeting may want to get up and make a plea for presenters</li>
                        <li>And now onto some business about user groups </li>

                        <li>
                            This is a philosophical discussion - literally three slides and done.  And this is a
                            discussion focused on the hiearchy for code storage and how you manage and distribute it
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            how many reuse code over multiple projects?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            how many have had to share that code? how do you share that code? how do you manage dependencies?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            how do you manage that code from a repository standpoint?  john g. has suggested that you don't
                            use repos to act as hard disks, but rather every checkin should be associated with a issue.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lots of discussion in the past about <i>using</i> repos but not a lot about managing the code
                            beyond how, when, why to check in
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What I want to know is how exactly do you transfer this reusable code if 1) you expect to
                            use it in other projects or 2) you want to be able to hand it over to others.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How do you manage it so that it is not a pain in the ass to deploy that code to
                        </li>

                    so...how do we organize this mess for redistribution?  Some scenarios:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You are developing a project for which you are expected to hand over and maintain the code for work
                            on a computer that will not be your own...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are working with projects on VMs and you want to maintain a common code base...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A coworker is using an instrument that you have developed the code to operate and would like
                            to work with it...
                        </li>

                        <td>
                            <img src="img/head-scratch.jpg" alt="">

                                <li class="fragment" index="2">A package manager - VIPM? Or...?</li>

                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Each version control system will come with it's own philosophy.  When I started, I went with
                            a subversion monorepository.  Every client would need to pull <i>all</i> of the code if they
                            wanted any.  In fact, I still do this even with git now, and here we are.... I have reusable
                            code that has branched such that it is now impossible to reconcile the two (and in some
                            instances even the API is touched).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How do you distribute code efficiently with a repo? Client generally doesn't want all of the
                            code (and in some instances, you can not provide all of it as it may contain some proprietary
                            code related to another project they are not privy to).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At CLD summit, one presenter provided us with google's repo tool used for Android code.
                            This could be effective at duplicating project structures as LV is not good at finding
                            the correct code unless it resides in the correct relative path.  But, this is cumbersome
                            for a client (and you when you have to explain exactly how to use this)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What about a package manager?  Man I hate VIPM - with no CLI, it is <i>cumbersome</i> to
                            use!  And the errors it produces are cryptic!  But, when it works, it works and it works well.
                            Deploy to vi.lib and LV out of the box will find it there if it can't find it anywhere else
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Like using google's repo tool, you will have to document carefully and make sure that all
                            of the dependencies are pulled in properly.  <i>AND</i> <b>I would suggest that the package
                            manager approach is not appropriate for code that is not mature (i.e. code actively under
                            development).</b>
                        </li>

                            so many awesome talks here and all because of people like you who were willing to get up

                            this has been a frustration of mine (and probably people who I am more familiar with as

                    <p>This is the basic structure of most AF applications.  There is a central controller that handles interaction amongst the various actors.  All messages will pass through it; cross communication is discouraged to prevent .  Messages will flow up and down the tree.</p>

                    Here, let's talk about the actual boiler plate:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Messages flow up and down the stack with flow managed by a central controller.</li>
                        <li>This means that we will have multiple messages achieving the same purpose.</li>
                        <li>Communicating with stateful subjects <em>within actors</em> will require further mechanisms to maintain the contract.</li>
                        <li>And, how do you push data around and maintain the current state of the system as a whole?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Not only do you have messages that flow up and down, but you also have to get your messages to the controller proper. Imagine,
                    <ol>
                        <li>Client sends message to server to change frequency of laser</li>
                        <li>Web service receives message and passes it on to controller in main app</li>
                        <li>Controller passes it on to appropriate instrument</li>
                        <li>Instrument then passes it on to portion running external to the main core that maintains state</li>
                    </ol>
                    That is potentially three seperate classes touching four separate entities!

                    <p>In RT, you can't debug a reentrant VI.  Since the AF is almost all reentrant, this makes the process <em>totally</em> fun.  Setting things such as the Message::Do or Actor::Actor Core to non-reentrant will cause the whole system to hang.  In instances where reentracny can not be changed, you will have to wrap funcionality.  At various points in this project you will find numerous VIs labeled "wrapper".</p>

                        on any machine with a browser - windows, linux, mac, phones, etc.  All code is hosted on the
                        server itself so all the client needs to do is point to the server.</p>
                    <p>This last sentence needs emphasizing - we have no code to deploy to the client.  This is pretty awesome when you think about it.  This means that any tools required to build and the run the code are totally transparent to the user.  This is important in the case of this application as the tool chain is pretty big for developing the UI.</p>

                <h2>Passing Data</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It will be text</li>
                    <li>It will be raw (if you are working with an RT system)</li>
                    <li>And it might look something like <a href="https://github.com/msr-consulting/exscalabar/blob/master/data/data.json">this 700 kB mess</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3 class="fragment">So what's up - why no gzip??</h3>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>In LV, you don't really have to think too hard about passing data. Natively, it will handle everything for you.  Hands up:
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do you typically pass data in an application?  What about between asynchronous processes?</li>
                        <li>How <em>would</em> you pass data to an external application?  One not running LV?</li>
                    </ul>
                    In a web service, you <em>will</em> be passing data as raw text.  You will <em>not</em> be flattening it.  That 700 kB packet is passed <em>every second</em> to the client to keep the data up to date (well, not entirely true - anything that doesn't require a history will be turned off depending on the view).  In addition, we have other information that is being pushed back and forth - CVT.  This is updated as need.  Together, these create issues for bandwidth limited situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>gzip is available on the Windows side via .NET libraries.  I have seen one stab at implementing gzip and my experience has been poor with this.</p>

                <h2>Serialization - what's that?</h2>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">
                    "..serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment."
                </blockquote>
                <p class="fragment">Nothing to see here. Nope.  </p>
                <p class="fragment">And certainly not the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/hf5f4fw">AQ Character Lineator</a>.</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>It's 2016, LV objects have been around since 2008 (at least) and we currently have <em>no</em> serializable object.  Le big sigh.  The current stab at this is the AQ charcter lineator - and I am not sure why this was even developed.  Performance is terrible because it is trying to do to many things so the class structure is very deep.</p>

                <h2>One last thing...</h2>
                <h3>deployment of web services is <em>terrible</em>.</h3>
                <h3>Really terrible.</h3>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>Aside from the fact that web services can throw all kinds of weird deployment errors, in RT when deploying, you will get <em>every</em> VI in the web service up on the screen.  This project has over 50 web service VIs so this makes deployment 1) slow and 2) obnoxious.  This is not what happens in the Windows environment.  Spoke to AE - after long discussion, they said this is what is supposed to happen?</p>
                    <p>Maybe show UI example?</p>
